5. Share the repository link into the Google Form: [https://forms.gle/2HbLP8GNiYArZFsj8](https://forms.gle/ufqFg2Kgk5C54Amn7)


## Problem Statement:
You are given an image which contains multiple headings and subheadings, perform suitable preprocessing techniques and computer vision approaches to extract the text in an organized format, write the python code to take the image input and create the organized dictionary as output. 

## Sample Input and output
### Input 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5695bba-0dfa-4144-8c09-1cabf8096b3e)
    ### Output
    ```json
    {
    "Ashoka Chakra": "Dharma Chakra (Wheel of Law)",
    "Saffron": "Represents strength and courage",
    "Green": "Represents fertility, growth, and auspiciousness of the land",
    "White": "Symbolizes peace and truth"
    }
```
### The Task
- Take the Image `sample.jpeg` present in this repository
- create a dictionary containing headers as keys and content as value
- submit the output screenshot
- write the readme on the approach that you followed

Our aim is to assess applicants' aptitude, innovative thinking, and their ability to comeup with new ways of solving problems, its an open ended assessment and candidate is free to innovate new ways of preprocessing or organizing the texts. 

### **Deliverables**:
- python script to take in image and output dictionary
- readme explaining steps to run the code
- readme explaination on the approaches followed
- demo video showing the output 
- 

**Push the source code along with a demo video of your solution into the forked github repo. Share the repo link in the google form: [https://forms.gle/2HbLP8GNiYArZFsj8](https://forms.gle/ufqFg2Kgk5C54Amn7)**
